# simplifido-frontend
Frontend for Simplifido, my Flatiron School Module 4 project. An app to help dog owners find walkers, pet sitters, and play sessions for their dogs.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to make posts to search for potential dog walkers, sitters, and play dates.

3. As a user, I want to be able to add dogs to my account.

## Install Instructions

For this project you will need to fork and clone both the [frontend](https://github.com/mattgahrns/simplifido-frontend/) and the [backend](https://github.com/mattgahrns/simplifido-backend/) then follow the steps below:

1. Open both repos in your IDE of choice.
2. On the front end run 'npm install' and on the backend run 'bundle install' in the terminal.
3. On the backend run 'rails db:migrate'.
4. On the backend run 'rails s -p 3001' (the -p flag stands for port and the number is the port you want to run the rails server on. Choose anything besides 3000, as 3000 will be the one that the npm server runs on).
5. On the frontend run 'npm start'.

The app should now be up and running in your default browser.
